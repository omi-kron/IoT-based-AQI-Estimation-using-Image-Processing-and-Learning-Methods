# IoT-based AQI Estimation using Image Processing and Learning Methods

Air pollution is a concern to the health of all
living beings. It is essential to check on the quality of air in
the surroundings. This article presents an IoT-based real-time
air quality index (AQI) estimation technique using images and
weather sensors on Indian rods. A mixture of image features,
i.e., traffic density, visibility, and sensor features, i.e., temperature
and humidity, were used to predict the AQI. Object detection and
localization-based Deep Learning (DL) method along with image
processing techniques were used to extract image features while
an Machine Learning (ML) model was trained on those features
to estimate the AQI. In order to conduct this experiment, a
dataset containing 5048 images along with co-located AQI values
across different seasons was collected by driving on the roads
of Hyderabad city in India. The experimental results report an
overall accuracy of 82% for AQI prediction.


## Novel Contributions of this work

- An IoT based novel methodology is proposed to estimate the real-time AQI into five levels using traffic images and weather parameters. 
- To the best of authors’ knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to achieve this on Indian roads.
- An entirely new traffic dataset is collected on Indian roads containing 5048 images and related weather data with co-located ground truth PM values. The dataset contains samples across the Indian city of Hyderabad in different seasons.
- The proposed method achieved overall 82% accuracy considering PM variation due to season.
